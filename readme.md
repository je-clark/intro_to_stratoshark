# Meet Stratoshark: Wireshark's Baby Brother

These resources are part of a talk delivered at the SouthEast Linux Fest 2025. This is meant to give people a brief introduction to the system call analysis possibilities of Stratoshark.

## Useful Links

To complete the exercises in this repo, both Wireshark and Stratoshark are required.

You can download Wireshark from [wireshark.org](wireshark.org).

And you can download Stratoshark from [stratoshark.org](stratoshark.org).

Ahead of the official version 1 release of Stratoshark, it may be most useful to download the latest development build, which can be found [here](https://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/). Just navigate to your OS and grab the latest-created date.

And finally, any study of system calls requires a reference document for all the different system calls, at least until you can memorize all 456 of them. [This is the best reference](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/) I've found for those system calls.

## Conclusion

I hope this becomes a useful resource for people learning to use Stratoshark. If you want to learn even more, you can find me, and several other Stratoshark enthusiasts on the Wireshark Discord server. You can also find my contact information at [www.jeclark.net](www.jeclark.net).
